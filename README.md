# BandSeer â€” Bandwidth Prediction for Cellular Networks

BandSeer is an efficient stacked Bi-LSTM-based architecture for bandwidth prediction that outperforms state-of-the-art prediction baselines.

It will be presented at the 49th [IEEE Conference on Local Computer Networks (LCN)](https://www.ieeelcn.org/).

The code will be added before the LCN 2024.
